        <h3> About Section </h3>
        <p>Hello</p>
        <p>I'm Florence Okoli - ALT/SOE/023/3546, a student of AltSchool Africa and I'm currently enrolled in the
            Tinyuka
            Semester for the Cloud Engineering track.</p>
        <p><b> Why AltSchool? </b>Having been on the self-learning path in the cloud for a year, I decided to experience some
            structured learning in order to become a world class cloud engineer. AltSchool has everything I was looking
            for!
            They're well-known for helping students become world-class engineers, which is something I aspire to be.</p>
        <p>Here is what I want to achieve at the end of my programme in Altschool. As a <b>World Class Devops/Cloud
                Engineer</b>, my goal is to design and manage scalable, secure cloud infrastructures, implement
            continuous
            integration and continuous deployment pipelines, specialize in cloud security, ensuring data protection,
            compliance, and threat mitigation within cloud environments enabling businesses globally to innovate and
            optimize their digital operations. </p>
